1 | Easy | [problem_1.py](problem_1.py) | Given a list of numbers, return whether any two sums to k.<br><br>For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.<br><br>Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?
2 | Hard | [problem_2.py](problem_2.py) | This problem was asked by Uber.<br><br>Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.<br><br>For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24].<br><br>If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].<br><br>Follow-up: what if you can't use division?
3 | Medium | [problem_3.py](problem_3.py) | This problem was asked by Google.<br><br>Given the root to a binary tree, implement serialize(root), which serializes the tree into a string, and deserialize(s), which deserializes the string back into the tree.<br><br>For example, given the following Node class<br><br>```class Node:
    def __init__(self, val, left=None, right=None):
